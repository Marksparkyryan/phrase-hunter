# phrase-hunter

Phrase Hunter is a simple terminal based game of guessing. Users are provided a random redacted phrase and are prompted to guess valid letters to unlock each character of the phrase. Users start with 5 lives and lose one life for each incorrect guess, eventually losing the game if all 5 lives are lost.
